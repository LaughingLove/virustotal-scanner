# VirusTotal Scanner

A python3 app that allows you to use the VirusTotal webapp service via the command line.


> ### Aren't there many other command-line VirusTotal apps out there?
Yes, but I made this because I was bored. So those other apps don't count. Just use mine instead :D

## *NOTICE*: This app no longer works and I don't really feel like updating it. Maybe one day I will.

## Requirements

### Linux
You must have `python 3.x` installed on your system. On linux you can check by entering the command `python3`. If not just follow your distro's guidelines for installing python3.
### Windows
If you have windows enter the command `python` and check if it says `Python 3.x`. If you have `python 2.x` installed you will have to install [python 3](https://www.python.org/) and set the environment variables correctly.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/LaughingLove/virustotal-scanner
cd virustotal-scanner
python3 main.py
```
